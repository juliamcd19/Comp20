            <p>OPERATIONS</p>
            <div class="aboutc3">
                <p>Pro EMS provides 911 and non-emergency transport services to the Cambridge and Emerson Paramedics service areas. We also provide a number of special operations services, including a 24/7 Incident Support Unit, mass casualty incident response, and disaster victim assistance. Pro EMS is pleased to provide coverage for special events, such as Bostonâ€™s Fourth of July, Harvard University commencement and athletics, and the Head of the Charles Regatta. <br> 
                Our paramedics and EMTs work in a tiered system: Advanced Life Support (ALS) units are staffed with two paramedics, or one paramedic and one EMT. Basic Life Support (BLS) units are staffed with two EMTs. The closest, most appropriate resource is assigned to emergency and non-emergency calls.</p>

            <div class="aboutc3">
                <p> Pro EMS utilizes its Field Evaluation and Training Program (FTEP) to ensure all of our new hires and newly promoted paramedics receive consistent and appropriate training and evaluation. <br> Pro EMS has stringent recertification and re-credentialing requirements upon hire for all paramedics and EMTs.  Every new Pro EMS field provider will have ALL recertification requirements completed, controlled, and documented by Pro EMS prior to assignment notwithstanding their current status or expiration date.  With this process, we are able to guarantee that all field provider credentials are complete, current, and legitimate.</p>
